Node Js Micro Service 

Catalog Microservice
This is a Catalog Microservice developed using TypeScript following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing products in a catalog. The service uses Express.js for routing and server configuration and Prisma as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions.

Features
Create Product: Add new products to the catalog.
Read Products: Fetch a single product by ID or retrieve a list of all products.
Update Product: Update an existing product's details.
Delete Product: Remove a product from the catalog.
Database Integration: Uses Prisma ORM to interface with a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.).
RESTful API: Built using Express.js to expose product management endpoints.
TypeScript: Ensures type safety and adherence to OOP principles.

Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
TypeScript: For type-safe development.
Express.js: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
Prisma: ORM for managing database operations.
PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite: Supported databases (configurable via Prisma).
Jest (optional): For unit testing.

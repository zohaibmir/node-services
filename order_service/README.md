Node Js Micro Service

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, and JavaScript supports both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. TypeScript augments JavaScript with static typing, which can actually enhance functional programming by providing type safety and better tooling.

In functional programming, the focus is on writing pure functions, avoiding side effects, and treating functions as first-class citizens. Let's go over some key functional programming concepts and how you can apply them in TypeScript.

Core Functional Programming Concepts in TypeScript
Pure Functions
Immutability
Higher-Order Functions
First-Class Functions
Function Composition
